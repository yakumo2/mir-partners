# Local Next.js App

This project was scaffolded manually to provide a lightweight starting point for building a Next.js application without reaching out to the network.

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev` / `npm run dev` – start the development server on http://localhost:3000
- `pnpm build` / `npm run build` – create an optimized production build
- `pnpm start` / `npm run start` – run the production server
- `pnpm lint` / `npm run lint` – run ESLint with the Next.js config

## Getting Started

Install dependencies with your preferred package manager, then start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

If you prefer npm or yarn, delete the existing `pnpm-lock.yaml` and install again with your tool of choice so the correct lockfile is generated.
